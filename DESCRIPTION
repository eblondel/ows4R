Description: Provides an Interface to Web-Services defined as standards by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), including Web Feature Service
 (WFS) for vector data, Catalogue Service (CSW) for ISO/OGC metadata and associated standards such as the common web-service specification (OWS) and
 OGC Filter Encoding. The long-term purpose is to add support for additional OGC service standards such as Web Coverage Service (WCS) and
 Web Processing Service (WPS).
