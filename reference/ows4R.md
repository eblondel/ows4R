# Interface to OGC Web-Services

Provides an Interface to Web-Services defined as standards by the Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC), including Web Feature Service (WFS) for
vector data, Web Coverage Service (WCS), Catalogue Service (CSW) for
ISO/OGC metadata, and associated standards such as the common
web-service specification (OWS) and OGC Filter Encoding. Partial support
is provided for the Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Processing Service
(WPS). The purpose is to add support for additional OGC service
standards such as Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) or OGC API.
